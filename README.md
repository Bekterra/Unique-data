# Unique-data
using data set android_data.csv, you want to create a barplot, but this time you have to compute  how many unique “x” received each of the companies  
– adobe.omniture, akamai.analytics, amazon.insight. 
It means to compute the number of “x”, say, for adobe.omniture where two other companies do not have “x”.
